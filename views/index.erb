  /**
    ASYNC ITERATION ASSIGNMENT!

    LEVEL 1: In playground.js, fix the iterative loop so that when you receive calls back from the server, the correct
      value for i is returned.
    
    LEVEL 2: Upon retrieving all of the callbacks from the server, sort them and construct the entire ordered string.
      Append them to #container. NOTE: to make sure that the string looks right, run a RegExp replace on the final string
      to replace "\n" with "<br />".

    LEVEL 3: Add a button to kick off this entire sequence. Upon receiving and appending your data from the server to the
    DOM, use setTimeout() to wait 3 seconds, and then request the data from the server again. Put these chunks in reverse
    order and append them to the DOM again.
